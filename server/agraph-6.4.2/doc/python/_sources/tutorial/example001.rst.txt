Example 1: Creating a repository and triple indices
---------------------------------------------------

Listing catalogs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. currentmodule:: franz.openrdf.sail.allegrographserver.AllegroGraphServer

The first task is to attach to our AllegroGraph Server and open a
repository. To achieve this we build a chain of Python objects, ending in
a "connection" object that lets us manipulate triples in a specific
repository. The overall process of generating the connection object
follows this diagram:

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| The first example opens (or          | |img-connection|                     |
| creates) a repository by building a  |                                      |
| series of client-side objects,       |                                      |
| culminating in a "connection"        |                                      |
| object.                              |                                      |
|                                      |                                      |
| The connection object contains the   |                                      |
| methods that let us manipulate       |                                      |
| triples in a specific repository.    |                                      |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

Before we start, we will extract the location of the AG server from environment
variables

.. testcode:: example1

   import os

   AGRAPH_HOST = os.environ.get('AGRAPH_HOST')
   AGRAPH_PORT = int(os.environ.get('AGRAPH_PORT', '10035'))
   AGRAPH_USER = os.environ.get('AGRAPH_USER')
   AGRAPH_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('AGRAPH_PASSWORD')

AllegroGraph connection functions use these environment variables as
defaults, but we will pass the values explicitly to illustrate how to
specify connection parameters in Python.

The example first connects to an AllegroGraph Server by providing the
endpoint (host IP address and port number) of an already-launched
AllegroGraph server. This creates a client-side server object, which can
access the AllegroGraph server's list of available catalogs through the
:meth:`~listCatalogs` method. Note that the name of the root catalog
will be represented by ``None``:

.. testcode:: example1

   from franz.openrdf.sail.allegrographserver import AllegroGraphServer

   print("Connecting to AllegroGraph server --",
         "host:'%s' port:%s" % (AGRAPH_HOST, AGRAPH_PORT))
   server = AllegroGraphServer(AGRAPH_HOST, AGRAPH_PORT,
                               AGRAPH_USER, AGRAPH_PASSWORD)
   print("Available catalogs:")
   for cat_name in server.listCatalogs():
       if cat_name is None:
           print('  - <root catalog>')
       else:
           print('  - ' + str(cat_name))

This is the output so far:

.. testoutput:: example1

    Connecting to AllegroGraph server -- host:'...
    Available catalogs:
      - <root catalog>
      ...

This output says that the server has the root catalog and possibly
also some other catalogs that someone has created for some
experimentation.

Listing repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the next part of this example, we use the :meth:`~openCatalog`
method to create a client-side catalog object. In this example we will
connect to the root catalog. When we look inside that catalog, we can
see which repositories are available:

.. testcode:: example1

   catalog = server.openCatalog('')
   print("Available repositories in catalog '%s':" % catalog.getName())
   for repo_name in catalog.listRepositories():
       print('  - ' + repo_name)

The corresponding output lists the available repositories. When you run
the examples, you may see a different list of repositories.

.. testoutput:: example1
   :hide:

   Available repositories in catalog ...

:: 

   Available repositories in catalog 'None':
    - pythontutorial
    - greenthings
    - redthings


Creating repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
.. currentmodule:: franz.openrdf.sail.allegrographserver.Catalog
    
The next step is to create a client-side repository object representing
the respository we wish to open, by calling the :meth:`~getRepository`
method of the catalog object. We have to provide the name of the desired
repository (``'python-tutorial'``), and select one of four access modes:

-  ``Repository.RENEW`` clears the contents of an existing repository
   before opening. If the indicated repository does not exist, it
   creates one.
-  ``Repository.OPEN`` opens an existing repository, or throws an
   exception if the repository is not found.
-  ``Repository.ACCESS`` opens an existing repository, or creates a new
   one if the repository is not found.
-  ``Repository.CREATE`` creates a new repository, or throws an
   exception if one by that name already exists.

.. testcode:: example1

   from franz.openrdf.repository.repository import Repository

   mode = Repository.RENEW
   my_repository = catalog.getRepository('python-tutorial', mode)
   my_repository.initialize()

.. currentmodule:: franz.openrdf.repository.repository.Repository
        
A new or renewed repository must be initialized, using the
:meth:`~initialize` method of the repository object.

Connecting to a repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
The goal of all this object-building has been to create a client-side
connection object, whose methods let us manipulate the triples of the
repository. The repository object's :meth:`~getConnection` method
returns this connection object.

.. testcode:: example1

   conn = my_repository.getConnection()
   print('Repository %s is up!' % my_repository.getDatabaseName())
   print('It contains %d statement(s).' % conn.size())

.. currentmodule:: franz.openrdf.repository.repositoryconnection.RepositoryConnection
        
The :meth:`~size` method of the connection object returns how many
triples are present. In the ``example1()`` function, this number
will always be zero because we "renewed" the repository.

This is the output so far:

.. testoutput:: example1
                
   Repository python-tutorial is up!
   It contains 0 statement(s). 

Managing indices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Whenever you create a new repository, you should stop to consider which
kinds of triple indices you will need. This is an important efficiency
decision. AllegroGraph uses a set of sorted indices to quickly identify
a contiguous range of triples that are likely to match a specific query
pattern.

These indices are identified by names that describe their organization.
The default set of indices are called **spogi, posgi, ospgi, gspoi,
gposi, gospi**, and **i** , where:

-  **S** stands for the subject URI.
-  **P** stands for the predicate URI.
-  **O** stands for the object URI or literal.
-  **G** stands for the graph URI.
-  **I** stands for the triple identifier (its unique id number within the
   triple store).

The order of the letters denotes how the index has been organized. For
instance, the **spogi** index contains all of the triples in the
store, sorted first by subject, then by predicate, then by object, and
finally by graph. The triple id number is present as a fifth column in
the index. If you know the URI of a desired resource (the *subject*
value of the query pattern), then the **spogi** index lets you quickly
locate and retrieve all triples with that subject.

The idea is to provide your respository with the indices that your
queries will need, and to avoid maintaining indices that you will never
need.

We can use the connection object's :meth:`listValidIndices` method to
examine the list of all possible AllegroGraph triple indices:

.. testcode:: example1

   indices = conn.listValidIndices()
   group_size = 5
   print('All valid triple indices:')
   for offset in range(0, len(indices), group_size):
       group = indices[offset:offset + group_size]
       print('  ', ' '.join(group))

This is the list of all possible valid indices:

.. testoutput:: example1

   All valid triple indices:
      spogi spgoi sopgi sogpi sgpoi
      sgopi psogi psgoi posgi pogsi
      pgsoi pgosi ospgi osgpi opsgi
      opgsi ogspi ogpsi gspoi gsopi
      gpsoi gposi gospi gopsi i

AllegroGraph can generate any of these indices if you need them, but it
creates only seven indices by default. We can see the current indices
by using the connection object's :meth:`~listIndices` method:

.. testcode:: example1

   indices = conn.listIndices()
   print('Current triple indices:', ', '.join(indices))

There are currently seven indices

.. testoutput:: example1

   Current triple indices: i, gospi, gposi, gspoi, ospgi, posgi, spogi

The indices that begin with "g" are sorted primarily by subgraph (or
"context"). If your application does not use subgraphs, you should
consider removing these indices from the repository. You don't want to
build and maintain triple indices that your application will never use.
This wastes CPU time and disk space. The connection object has a
convenient :meth:`~dropIndex` method:

.. testcode:: example1

   print("Removing graph indices...")
   conn.dropIndex("gospi")
   conn.dropIndex("gposi")
   conn.dropIndex("gspoi")
   indices = conn.listIndices()
   print('Current triple indices:', ', '.join(indices))

Having dropped three of the triple indices, there are now four
remaining:

.. testoutput:: example1 

   Removing graph indices...
   Current triple indices: i, ospgi, posgi, spogi

The **i** index is for deleting triples by using the triple id number.
It is also required for :ref:`free text indexing <example12>`.  The
**ospgi** index is sorted primarily by object value, which makes it
possible to efficiently retrieve a range of object values from the
index. Similarly, the **posgi** index lets us quickly reach for a
triples that all share the same predicate. We mentioned previously
that the **spogi** index speeds up the retrieval of triples that all
have the same subject URI.

As it happens, we may have been overly hasty in eliminating all of the
graph indices. AllegroGraph can find the right matches as long as there
is *any* one index present, but using the "right" index is much faster.
Let's put one of the graph indices back, just in case we need it. We'll
use the connection object's :meth:`~addIndex` method:

.. testcode:: example1

   print("Adding one graph index back in...")
   conn.addIndex("gspoi")
   indices = conn.listIndices()
   print('Current triple indices:', ', '.join(indices))
   
.. testoutput:: example1

    Adding one graph index back in...
    Current triple indices: i, gspoi, ospgi, posgi, spogi

Releasing resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
Both the connection and the repository object must be closed to
release resources once they are no longer needed. We can use the
:meth:`~.Repository.shutDown` and :meth:`~.RepositoryConnection.close`
methods to do this:

.. testcode:: example1

   conn.close()
   my_repository.shutDown()

It is safer and more convenient to ensure that the resources are
released by using the ``with`` statement:

.. testcode:: example1

   with catalog.getRepository('python-tutorial', Repository.OPEN) as repo:
       # Note: an explicit call to initialize() is not required
       # when using the `with` statement.
       with repo.getConnection() as conn:
           print('Statements:', conn.size())

.. testoutput:: example1

Utility functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. currentmodule:: franz.openrdf.connect

Creating the intermediate server, catalog and repository objects can
be tedious when the only thing required is a single connection to one
repository. In such circumstances it might be more convenient to use
the :func:`~ag_connect` function. That is what we will do in further
examples. Here is a brief example of using :func:`~ag_connect`

.. testcode:: example1

   from franz.openrdf.connect import ag_connect

   with ag_connect('python-tutorial', create=True, clear=True) as conn:
       print('Statements:', conn.size())

This function take care of creating all required objects and the
returned context manager ensures that all necessary initialization
steps are taken and no resources are leaked. The ``create`` and
``clear`` arguments ensure that the repository is empty and that it is
created if necessary.
